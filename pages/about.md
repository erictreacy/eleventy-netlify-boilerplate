## Hi, I'm Eric!

I'm a chemist currently living in Marquette, Michigan working at [Peninsula Pharmacy](https://penpharm.com/) 
and building software. I love science and technology &mdash; and this is my space on the web.

## The deets

I'm a polymath: proficiencies range from bench science to software development: 

*From 2008 - 2015*, I oscillated my time between [National Jewish Health](https://www.nationaljewish.org/home) and [The University of Colorado &mdash; Anschutz Medical Campus](http://www.ucdenver.edu/anschutz/Pages/landing.aspx)
researching the Life Sciences in Pediatric Rheumatology and Immunology with [Philippa Marrack, PhD, FRS](https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/providers/researchers/philippa-marrack) and 
[Leonard Dragone, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonard-dragone-94125474/). 

*From 2014 - current*, I work(ed) in Software Development for [The Texas Medical Association](https://www.texmed.org/), [Xeratec Corporation](https://xeratec.com/) and [Baby E's BBQ](https://babyesbbq.com) &mdash; and continue to 
create &amp; contribute to OSS for fun.

Outside of work, I spend my time with my family playing outdoors and traveling. 

## What's with the site?

I enjoy design &mdash; and this space is my creative outlet. I design/engineer with code using various web technologies. In my personal time, 
I love working with (S)CSS. Other Languages/platforms I enjoy &mdash; in a netshell &mdash; include HTML, JavaScript, Go, Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, ASP.Net, etc. Pretty much anything that will get me to where I need to be. I am always learning and 
discovering.
